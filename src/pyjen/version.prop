# Unlike a typical Python script, this file is a properties file. It may
# only contain comments and a single Python literal declaration representing
# the version number of the project. This makes the property easy to parse
# from various tools, including Python using the "ast" library. See
# "ast.literal_eval()" for details.
"0.0.15"
